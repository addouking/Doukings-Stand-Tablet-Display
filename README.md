<h1>Deck-like Display</h1>

A deck like display for anything, customizable for displaying anything, like a dashboard. <br>
<h4>Can display data from: </h4>

- pc (cpu/gpu temps, storage) 
- time 
- weather 
- data from internet like a counter for something 
- anything else that comes to your mind. 

Will be made with looks in mind and look aestethically pleasing on a desk.

Alongside the screen, it will have 6 buttons that can be configured to do specific tasks on a pc, like running an app, running a command, setting a setting, etc.. and a rotary encoder for volume on pc if connected. It will be able to run standalone for non pc related stuff.

This project will also most likely not need a PCB.

May need to cut on parts of the app because the pi 0 2w has very low ram and prices in my country are taxed to hell so i cant go with a pi 3

The files have not been uploaded yet, this will be removed when i do. Nothing in the repo is final.

I have access to a 3d printer and will be able to get my model printed myself.
